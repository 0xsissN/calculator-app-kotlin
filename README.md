# Calculator App

This project is a calculator application developed in Kotlin, designed to perform a variety of mathematical and programming operations. The application includes three types of calculators: basic, advanced, and programmer.

## Description

The application includes the following functionalities:

1. **Basic Calculator**: Performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, including operator precedence.

2. **Advanced Calculator**: Supports advanced mathematical operations such as trigonometric functions (cos, sin, tan), hyperbolic functions (cosh, sinh, tanh), factorials, roots, powers, logarithms (log10, ln), and other arithmetic operations.

3. **Programmer Calculator**: Allows conversions between different numerical systems (decimal, binary, hexadecimal, octal) and performs bitwise operations such as NOT, AND, OR, right shift (`>>`), and left shift (`<<`).

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Main programming language.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android toolkit for building native user interfaces.

## Tests

A total of 128 unit tests have been implemented to ensure the proper functioning of the application:

- **Basic Calculator**: 32 tests.
- **Advanced Calculator**: 64 tests.
- **Programmer Calculator**: 32 tests.
